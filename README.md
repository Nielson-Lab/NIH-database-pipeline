Because the application is a large binary file, we have compressed the folder the application resides in and are sharing it as a Release. This proces will also keep users updated about changes to the application throughout the various stages. 

The folder contains the application, an Inputs folder with sample datasets, an Outputs folder (where results will be saved), and an Instructions file. **Do not** move any of the contents outside of the folder or within in the folder. 

On the right side of this page, you will see a "Releases" section (underneath the "About" section). Find the most recent MacOS and Windows versions of the application, then click on "Assets" underneath. You only need to download the application ZIP file. Only download the version that is compatible with your system.
